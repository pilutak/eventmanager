# eventmanager
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/timezone4/eventmanager.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/timezone4/eventmanager)

A Broadworks OCI-R Client application that keep connections to one or more Broadsoft Broadworks application servers
, handles recieves OCI-R events, and provisions the Ericsson IMS core (HSS-FE and ENUM-FE).

This is work in progress. I need to write documentation before it us
usable, but as such the eventmanager should support provisioning of:

  - Users
  - Huntgroups
  - Auto attendants
  - Call centers
  - Meet-Me conferences
  - Voiceportals
  - Voicemails

I would love to get some feedback and help building this thing.

## Installation:

```
make
